# BookKey
BookKey is a price comparison application designed for students and avid readers. It can scan the ISBN of a book, and quickly looks through over 20 different websites to find the best price for you. It then provides a list of links where the user can then purchase the book. BookKey was designed to help students find textbooks for cheap quicker, as well as help those who want to keep reading find their next novel.


BookKey is an iOS app currently in Beta. If you would like to download it and try it out, click on this link:
