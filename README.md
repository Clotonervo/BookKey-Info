# BookKey
BookKey is a price comparison application designed for students and avid readers. It can scan the ISBN of a book, and quickly looks through over 20 different websites to find the best price for you. It then provides a list of links where the user can then purchase the book. BookKey was designed to help students find textbooks for cheap quicker, as well as help those who want to keep reading find their next novel.


BookKey is an iOS app that made it to beta. After extensive testing, this project has been discontinued. If you would like to learn more about this project, email me at slam.hopkins@gmail.com for more information. I can also give you access to the base code, if you would like to start learning Swift yourself!
